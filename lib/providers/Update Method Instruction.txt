How to use the update*** methods:

1. Call the methods
2. In the parameters of the methods, create a map with these {}
3. look at the variables of the model you want to update, for the example, it will be project_model
4. On the left side of the Map, put the field name you want to update. MUST BE EXACT so copy paste from the model field
5. On the right side of the Map, put the new value for that field. MUST BE THE SAME VARIANLE TYPE

Example:
I want to change project name and description.

updateProject(projectID, {
    'name': 'New Name',
    'description' : 'New description'

});
